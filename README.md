Data Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge: Python, Pandas, and Jupyter

1. Use starter code from "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" and finish calculations in each cell as instructed.
2. Write two observable trends in the PyCity Schools Analysis.

I was able to find examples for most of the code for this challenge. Where I could not find examples, a classmate filled in the gaps. In the Schoool Summary, I got stuck on calculating all the school types with unique values without brackets around each "type" in the final output. Apparently, this code was supposed to be provided in the sample solution. Received from TA via a classmate.
